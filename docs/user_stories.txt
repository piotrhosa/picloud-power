I want to see real-time data for the power consumption of the whole tower
So that I can identify the total power consumption

As an admin 
I want to see real-time data for the power consumption of individual nodes in the tower (as many as posisble)
So that I can identify the total power consumption

As an admin
I want to see real-time data for the power consumption for selected nodes
So that I can determine what the power consumption is in various states (idle etc)

As an admin
I want to see real-time CPU temperatures in my cluster in a graph
So that I know how they compare with power consumption (on the same graph)

As an admin 
I want to see real-time CPU loads in my cluster in a graph
So that I know how they compare with power consumption (on the same graph)

As an admin
I want to be able to change the power, temperature and load sampling frequency
So that I can instantaneously have an overview of the data as well as a closer look whenever I want to

As an admin
I want to see a diagram representation of the cluster with color coding indicating faults or extreme conditions (such as high temperature)
So that I have a good overview and can identify which nodes exhibit abnormal behavior

As an admin
I want to see a real-time, color-coded diagram representation of the cluster (power, temp, load)
So that I have a good a better insight into faults like duration and magnitude

As an admin
I want to see an alert queue that is separate from any other diagram and displays an alert when I need to take action (maybe email alert as well)
So that I have a clear indication when I need to respond quickly

As an admin 
I want to be able to turn off or reboot nodes from the GUI
So that I have an easy way of dealing with non-responsive nodes

As an admin
I want to be able to see pods running on each node in real time
So I have a better understanding for the level of the node's power consumption

As an admin
I want to be able to access log files for power usage (csv)
So that I can safely store data and analyze it later
